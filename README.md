# eclipse-school

Welcome to **Eclipse**, my little school project that I've worked on for a while based on a management system of a 'cybercafe': Where people pay to use computers to access the internet or play games. The name Eclipse pays tribute to a cybercafe that I would go to with my friends and a place I made a lot of memories in, which had closed down recently at the time of making this program.

This program features employee accounts with various levels of privilege, user accounts (with a bonus for VIP customers!), and a full-fletched ticketing system to keep track of all the transactions and the time they were processed.
